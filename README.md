# WFH Alert

[WFH Alert](https://wfhalert.com) is a daily email that shares new work from home jobs.  
Most jobs are low-barrier, don’t require a degree, and are easy to apply for.

We help people from all backgrounds — including moms, students, and those without traditional experience — find real remote jobs without wasting hours on job boards.
